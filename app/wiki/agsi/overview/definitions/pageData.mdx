# Glossary of Definitions related to Artifical Intelligence (AI)

## Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

"AGI is basically the equivalent of a median human that you could hire as a
co-worker and then they could do anything that you'd be happy with a remote co-worker doing, just behind a computer, which includes learning how to go be a doctor, learning how to go be a very competent coder. There's a lot of stuff that a median human is capable of getting good at and I think one of the skills of an AGI is not any particular milestone, but a meta skill of learning to figure things out and that it can go decide to get good at whatever you need"    
<Star /> Sam Altman, [Conversation at Greylock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd9GxG5Qn-k)

"A three-letter acronym doesn’t capture the enormity of what AGI would represent, so I will refer to it as what is: God-like AI. A superintelligent computer that learns and develops autonomously, that understands its environment without the need for supervision and that can transform the world around it... God-like AI could be a force beyond our control or understanding, and one that could usher in the obsolescence or destruction of the human race."  
<Star /> Ian Hogarth, [Essay in the Financial Times](ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2)

"Tesla AI might play a role in AGI, given that it trains against the outside world, especially with the advent of Optimus."  
<Star /> Elon Musk, [Tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1483728729545363457)

"OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity."  
<Star /> Open AI, [Charter](https://openai.com/charter)

"Our long term aim is to solve intelligence, developing more general and capable problem-solving systems, known as artificial general intelligence (AGI)."  
<Star /> DeepMind, [About DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/about)

"I use [AGI] as a shorthand for any intelligence (there might be many) that is flexible and general, with resourcefulness and reliability comparable to (or beyond) human intelligence."  
<Star /> Gary Marcus, [Tweet](https://twitter.com/GaryMarcus/status/1529457162811936768)

"It is important to keep in mind that the definition of AI is still evolving and that achievements in the field today have been in task-specific AI or “narrow AI”, as opposed to what is commonly called artificial general intelligence that can learn a wide range of tasks—like humans."  
<Star /> IT Modernization - Centers of Excellence - General Services Administration, [AI Guide for Government](https://coe.gsa.gov/coe/ai-guide-for-government/what-is-ai-key-terminology/index.html)

## Artificial Super Intelligence

"We can tentatively define a superintelligence as any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest."  
<Star /> Nick Bostrom, [Superintelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/20527133)

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

"The essence of intelligence is the principle of adapting to the environment while working with insufficient knowledge and resources. Accordingly, an intelligent system should rely on finite processing capacity, work in real time, open to unexpected tasks, and learn from experience. This working definition interprets 'intelligence' as a form of 'relative rationality'.
