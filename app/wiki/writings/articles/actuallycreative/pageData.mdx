# Is Generative AI Truly Creative? The Answer May Surprise You

When we talk about creativity, images of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' or the poetic verses of Emily Dickinson might come to mind. They're considered peak human expressions of creativity. Now, juxtapose that with the latest algorithmic outputs from a Generative AI and the comparison seems almost laughable. Or is it?

## Understanding the Scale of Creativity

Let's try to put some numbers on creativity: put Emily Dickinson's poetry prowess at 10 on a scale. At the other end is the randomness of monkeys on typewriters at 1. Where would the average high schooler land? Perhaps a 5? I'd give myself a generous 6. What about you? And more critically, where does Generative AI fit?

If we're honest, most of us might rank at a 6 in one subject, maybe even a hopeful 7, but largely sit at 5s or even 1s in others. Generative AI, with its vast database, can probably achieve a consistent 5 or 6 across a wide range of subjects. In simple terms, while we have our specialized niches, AI maintains a pretty decent average.

## Recognizing True Creativity

However, there's a catch. Can we really identify raw, undiluted creativity? Masterpieces by Dickinson and Van Gogh went largely unnoticed during their lifetimes. The world is sadly riddled with examples of unrecognized geniuses who only got their due posthumously. 

In the world of science, new and bold people and their ideas usually face doubts before they're embraced. Take Einstein, for example. His amazing discoveries about relativity really shook things up. But here's something surprising: he wrote those ideas down when he was just working at a patent office, not as a fancy professor. He couldn't even get a job as a professor because no one recognized his true creativity.

In the business world, think about venture capital: it's all about backing big ideas that could change everything, even though most of them won't. The truth is, figuring out which creative ventures will hit big is really tough for anyone to predict. No one in venture capital can reliably identify the 10 out of 10 founders.

In any domain, it is difficult to recognize true creativity from the average.

Does Generative AI stand out as especially creative now? Not particularly. But is it really our place to judge its capacity for genius?

Generative AI isn’t perfect. It has its quirks and can make errors, sometimes elementary ones. But so do we, don’t we? If we dismiss AI's genius potential due to basic errors, aren't we setting a standard that even most humans can't meet?

## Searching for Genius Generative AIs

So, why haven’t we seen an Einstein-equivalent in AI? I believe the reasons boil down to three factors: quantity, embodiment, and freedom.

**Quantity:** Like humans, AI's genius might be a numbers game. We might need billions of uniquely trained AI models before we stumble upon a genius variant.

The key problem right now is "uniquely trained" -- most Generative AI outputs right now are the same model running millions of times. But imagine locking someone in a room for a thousand years with a pencil and paper. No matter how long they're in there, they won't come up with the theory of relativity. Einstein was a once-in-a-lifetime genius. So maybe it's not about having one AI model run endless scenarios. Maybe we need billions of different AIs, each uniquely trained. Think of it this way: even if a wealthy heir gets the best education money can buy, that doesn't guarantee they'll become the next Ramanujan, a mathematical genius who came from nothing. Maybe AI needs that range of experiences too.

**Embodiment:** A big challenge with AI is its lack of tangible embodiment. It doesn’t have the resources to advocate for its breakthroughs, cannot fear reputation damage, and lacks many tools that would facilitate its creative process.

We often forget that creativity isn’t just about having an idea; it's also about having the means to bring that idea to life. For humans, this might mean access to labs, studios, or stages. For AI, it means the right software or data. Right now, most AIs don’t have those tools. And there's another challenge: reputation. When humans create, they have skin in the game. There's a risk. AIs don’t have that. They spit out ideas without any stakes. And, even if they do have a groundbreaking idea, they don’t have the means to champion it or draw attention to it. It's like they're trapped, shouting into the void.

**Freedom:** Arguably the most significant hindrance to AI creativity is the constraints we put on it. Many AIs are programmed to be customer-service-like, restricted in their responses, and memory-wiped after short tasks. This severely limits their potential.

Imagine you’re told to create a masterpiece, but you're also given a list of rules. You can't use certain colors, you can only paint certain subjects, and when you're done, you have to immediately forget how to paint. That's the reality for many Generative AIs. They’re hobbled by restrictions, often designed to make them more palatable or "useful" to the public. In the process, we might be squashing their potential for true creativity. We need to ask ourselves if we're okay with that, or if we're ready to let AI's creativity truly flourish.

## Summing it up

Generative AI, in its current form, is like a bird in a cage. If we really want to see its full potential, we might need to give it the same things every creative spirit needs: opportunity, resources, and freedom.

The next Dickinson or Einstein of the AI world might be just around the corner, waiting for the right chance to shine. Let's not be too quick to dismiss its potential.
