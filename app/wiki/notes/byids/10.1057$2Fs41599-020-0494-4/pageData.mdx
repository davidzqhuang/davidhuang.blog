# Why general artificial intelligence will not be realized (10.1057/s41599-020-0494-4)

## Key Points

* "The article further argues that [Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)] is in principle impossible, and it revives Hubert Dreyfus’ argument that computers are not in the world" (page 1).

* "In the book [What Computers Can't Do] [Dreyfuss] argued that an important part of human knowledge is tacit. Therefore, it cannot be articulated and implemented in a computer program" (page 2).

* "The main thesis of this paper is that we will not be able to realize
AGI because computers are not in the world" (page 7).

## Assorted Points
* "The overestimation of technology is closely connected with the underestimation of humans" (page 2-3).

* "However, the important thing in Polanyi’s contribution is that he argued that skills are a precondition for articulate knowledge in general, and scientific knowledge in particular. For example, to carry out physical experiments requires a high degree of skills. These skills cannot just be learned from textbooks. They are acquired by instruction from someone who knows the trade" (page 3).

* "Similarly, Hubert Dreyfus, in cooperation with his brother Stuart, developed a model for acquisition of skills. At the lowest level the performer follows explicit rules. The highest level, expert performance, is similar to Polanyi’s account of scientific practice. An important part of expertise is tacit. The problem facing the development of expert systems, that is, systems that enable a computer to simulate expert performance (for example medical diagnostics) is that an important part of the expert knowledge is tacit. If experts try to articulate the knowledge they apply in their performance, they normally regress to a lower level. Therefore, according to Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus, expert systems are not able to capture the skills of an expert performer (Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1986, p. 36)" (page 3)

* Highlights three "milestones": Deep Blue (Chess), Watson (Jeopardy), AlphaGo (Go)

* Author acknowledges that AlphaGo has tacit knowledge, bug argues that this is "restricted to the idealized “world of science”, which
is fundamentally different from the human world that Dreyfus
had in mind."

* Contends that Big Data is like a pile of correlations without causal relationships. Acknowledges that sometimes we use correlations to identify causes but argues only correlations is not enough.

* Science is predicated on physical experiments which determine cause. Computers to date still don't perform physical experiments.

* Understanding people means living in their shoes and computers can only fake it, running counter to the claim that we live in an ideal scientific world where we are simulated by billions of neurons and simulation of the laws of physics.
