# Generative AI at Work (10.3386/w31161)

## Key Points

* "AI assistance increases worker productivity, resulting in a 13.8 percent increase in the number of chats that an agent is able to successfully resolve per hour." (page 2)
* "AI assistance disproportionately increases the performance less skilled and less experienced workers across all productivity measures we consider." (page 2)
* "High-skill workers may have less to gain from AI assistance precisely because AI recommendations capture the potentially tacit knowledge embodied in their own behaviors." (page 2)
* "AI assistance markedly improves how customers treat agents, as measured by the sentiments of their chat messages... turnover decreases, particularly for newer workers, and customers are less likely to escalate a call by asking to speak to an agent’s supervisor." (page 2)

## Assorted Points

* "Computers and software have transformed the economy... typically [requiring] explicit and detailed instructions ... Yet because many production processes rely on tacit knowledge, these processes have so far defied automation" (page 1).

* "AI recommendations helps workers move more quickly down the experience curve" (page 14, page 35, Figure 9).
