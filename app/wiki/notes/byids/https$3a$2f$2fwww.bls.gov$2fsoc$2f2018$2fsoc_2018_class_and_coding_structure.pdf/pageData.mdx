# Standard Occupational Classification and Coding Structure

The occupations in the SOC are classified at four levels of aggregation to suit the needs of various data users: **major group**, **minor group**, **broad occupation**, and **detailed occupation**. Each lower level of detail identifies a more specific group of occupations. The 23 major groups, listed below, are divided into 98 minor groups, 459 broad occupations, and 867 detailed occupations.

Some users may require aggregations other than the SOC system built on these major groups. Further details on alternate occupational aggregations and approved modifications to the SOC structure are provided in the following section, **Approved modifications to the structure**.

Major groups are broken into minor groups, which, in turn, are divided into broad occupations. Broad occupations are then divided into one or more detailed occupations, as follows:

29-0000 Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations
 29-1000 Health Diagnosing or Treating Practitioners
  29-1020 Dentists
   29-1022 Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

* Major group codes end with 0000 (e.g., 29-0000 Healthcare Practitioners and Technical
Occupations).
* Minor groups generally end with 000 (e.g., 29-1000 Health Diagnosing or Treating
Practitioners)â€”the exceptions are minor groups 15-1200 Computer Occupations, 31-
1100 Home Health and Personal Care Aides; and Nursing Assistants, Orderlies, and
Psychiatric Aides, and 51-5100 Printing Workers, which end with 00.
* Broad occupations end with 0 (e.g., 29-1020 Dentists).
* Detailed occupations end with a number other than 0 (e.g., 29-1022 Oral and
Maxillofacial Surgeons).
