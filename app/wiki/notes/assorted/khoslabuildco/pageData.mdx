# Company Building with Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures

AI-guided notes from the lecture given at [Khosla Ventures CEO Summit 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRCoBgC_n1Q)

**People seldom realize there's a massive difference between a zero million dollar company and a zero billion dollar company, even with the same number of people.** 

- **Difference lies in**: 
  - The culture
  - The mission
  - The people 
  - The way they discuss their vision 

### **Building a Billion-Dollar Company with Zero Billion in Revenue**
- **Startups** are about passion for a vision. They have the spirit of "Cat in the Hat".
  - _Side note_: The slide depicting this was one I used in my first startup at Daisy Systems in my business plan presentation. Technology has changed since, but the sentiment remains.
  
- **Recognizing the Difference**: I often see this distinction and have debated many of you on seemingly minor points. Mark and I often discuss this very difference.

- **Startup Process**: It's about strategy. 
  - **Objective**: Leverage your assets and minimize your liabilities.
    - Many business plans only focus on the assets and forget that minimizing liabilities is equally crucial.
  
  - **Initial Phase**: 
    - Start with a short-term advantage to get your foot in the door, often a technological one.
    - This should then be turned into a long-term asset.
  
  - **Experimentation**: 
    - Early stages of a startup should be about organized chaos. 
    - As you grow, this should shift into a more execution-oriented phase.

- **Main Goal of a Startup**: Optimize risk management.
  - **Building Teams**: An essential element I'll delve into.
  - **Sales**: "Sell, sell, sell" is the motto.
    - _Note_: I won't discuss the sales pitch in detail today. I'll save it for another time when Carmen isn't around for comparison.

### **Risk Management**
- **Core Task**: Managing various types of risks.
  - If aiming for a billion-dollar valuation, think big but act small to keep expenses in check.
  
- **Real Test**: The trade-offs you decide upon and the conviction and courage to chase the billion-dollar dream using million-dollar strategies.
  - A saying from last year that still holds: "Be obstinate about your vision, but flexible about your tactics."
  
- **Big Hairy Audacious Goals**: It's an art form to balance these.
  - Risk management means setting smaller goals that align with the bigger vision.
  - If your startup goal is climbing Mount Everest, reaching Basecamp is crucial. 
    - However, many lead their ventures to a Basecamp that doesn't even offer a view of Everest. Herein lies the importance of tactical choices. Your Basecamp should pave the way to Everest.

### **Validation of Every Element**

- Just because you believe in something doesn't mean you're right.
  - In reality, many of our initial beliefs may be mistaken.

- It's essential not to get too caught up in executing perfectly according to plans.
  - I've witnessed many companies build the wrong thing, albeit on budget and on time.

- **Prioritize Testing Assumptions**
  - Before worrying about perfect execution, ensure that what you're trying to build is actually the right thing.
  
- **Planning and Efficiency**
  - It's alright to be inefficient initially.
  - Flexible ("if-then") planning is more beneficial than rigid planning, especially when you're still unsure of many elements.
    - As an earlier speaker mentioned, there's no point in planning if you're uncertain about your direction.
  
- **Fostering a Culture of Experimentation**
  - I've highlighted the importance of managing risks.
  - There are myriad risks in the startup phases:
    - Financial risk
    - People risk
    - Technology risk
    - Market risk
    - Investor risk
    - Groupthink risk
    - ... and more.

- If time permitted, I'd delve into each risk, but for now, I'll focus on a couple.

- **Making Trade-offs in Decision Making**
  - For instance, if you don't raise more funds, you're taking on a financial risk.
  - Adding more features to a product increases financial risk but might mitigate market risk.
  - Conversely, having fewer features might reduce investor risk.

### **Financial Risk**

- **Common Mistake**: Many people blindly believe their assumptions without validating them.
  - _Reference_: The concept of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is thoroughly explained in a recommended book.
  
- **Planning**: 
  - It's better to plan for the unplanned rather than rigidly adhering to a set plan.
  - Reflect on your recent history. Many things you know today weren't anticipated a year or two ago. 
  - What you learn today will evolve, and by next year, there'll be new discoveries.
  - The importance of flexible planning ("flexi planning") can't be overstated, especially concerning financial risk management.

- **Contingency Planning**: 
  - The worst-case scenario or contingency plan is crucial.
  - One must avoid the pitfall of running out of funds.

- **Budgeting and Expenses**:
  - In board meetings, I often advocate planning for 'wasted money'—a concept that isn't always well-received.
  - It's vital to consider the risk vs. the time and expense curve. Rather than simply looking at time vs. burn rate, focus on risk reduction points. Base financial risk management on risk triggers, not just time.
  - _Reference_: A blog post by Brad Feld titled "Creating 1x Downside" is highly recommended. The idea is to ensure failures are small and not catastrophic.

### **People Risk**

- **Hiring**:
  - Hiring based solely on functional roles is a mistake.
  - The people you recruit will shape the trajectory of your company more than any written plan will.

- **Emphasizing People Risks**:
  - Once financial risks are managed, the next significant risk factor is people.

- **Founder and CEO Responsibilities**:
  - As previously discussed, there's a vast difference between a zero-million-dollar company and a zero-billion-dollar company.
  - Consistency with the company's vision is crucial. It requires courage to maintain a broader vision amidst the numerous short-term distractions and decisions.
  
- **Prioritizing**:
  - Be proactive about setting and maintaining priorities.
  - Many leaders spend their time reacting rather than being proactive. If, on Sunday night, 50% of your upcoming week isn't free, you're likely to be reactive.
  - Emergency tasks will likely consume half of the "free" time, leading to 75% of reactive work. Only 25% of proactive efforts are possible under such conditions.
  - Leaders must be proactive. If you're perpetually reacting—be it to phone calls, emails, or crises—you're not truly leading.

### **Building the Right Team for Your Startup**

#### **1. Everyone Wants the Best:**
- Most companies state they want the best talent, but when asked about their strategy, their answers are often vague.

#### **2. Emphasis on Diversity:**
- **Engineering Diversity**: Essential for a company's success.
  - **Importance**: It leads to a merger of ideas and random interactions, which can spark innovation.
  - **Types of Diversity**: Age, industry background, company background, nationality, etc.
- **The Challenge**: People often hire those similar to themselves. Overcoming this bias can lead to long-term success.

#### **3. Manager vs. Visionary:**
- **Visionaries**: People who think big and often seem unreasonable. They may not always be pragmatic.
- **Managers**: Those focused on day-to-day operations and management.
- Ideally, a startup needs both. For example, the founder as the visionary CEO and a president as the manager.

#### **4. Focus on Strengths and Recognize Weaknesses:**
- Companies rarely fail because of their strengths but due to the areas they neglect.
- Diversity helps address "unknown unknowns" by bringing in a mix of experiences and perspectives.

#### **5. Gene Pool Engineering: How to Build a Great Team:**
- **Step 1**: Identify Risks - Recognize what can make or break your startup.
- **Step 2**: For each risk, identify target companies with expertise in that area.
- **Step 3**: List down potential hires from these companies who've dealt with similar challenges.
- **Step 4**: Prioritize these individuals based on their potential impact on mitigating your startup's risks.

#### **6. Learning from Others' Mistakes:**
- By hiring individuals who have faced challenges before, you can avoid making the same errors.
- It often feels like startups find every wrong way to do something before discovering the right way.
- One strategy for success is to learn from those who've already encountered and overcome obstacles.

In conclusion, building the right team involves more than just hiring top talent. It's about cultivating a diverse environment, balancing visionary and managerial roles, and learning from the mistakes and successes of others. By strategically engineering your company's "gene pool", you can significantly increase your chances of success.

### **Hiring and Building a Successful Team**

---

#### **1. The Challenge of Hiring Outside of Your Expertise:**
- Founders, particularly technical ones, often struggle to hire in domains they're unfamiliar with, e.g., a CFO or VP of Marketing.
- There's a [paper on our website](#) to help founders navigate this challenge.

#### **2. The Cost of Wrong Hires:**
- Incorrect hiring decisions can have a high cost, often affecting the trajectory and growth of a startup.
  
#### **3. The Influence of Board Members:**
- While diversity of opinion is valuable, it's essential to be mindful of the influence board members can have on your company's direction.
- [Another paper](#) details how to select and manage your board effectively.

#### **4. The Importance of Early Hires:**
- Early employees aren't just about completing initial tasks; they're instrumental in hiring future talent.
- The difference in growth trajectory between hiring task-oriented individuals and those focused on long-term company building can be significant.

#### **5. Don’t Just Fill Roles, Collect Talent:**
- Instead of just hiring to fill specific roles, focus on attracting and retaining top talent regardless of title.
- Innovative thinking can emerge from unexpected sources, like the database expert who influenced the file system at Sun Microsystems.
- Create flexible roles and titles if it means bringing in exceptional talent.

#### **6. Interdependence of Top Roles:**
- It's not enough for leaders in one department to excel only in their domain. They should also uplift and enhance other departments.
- A successful VP of Engineering should make the marketing, sales, and finance departments better and vice versa.

#### **7. The Complexity of Company Building:**
- Building a company involves juggling multiple factors and considerations.
- While this talk touched on a few critical areas, there are many more facets to company building that deserve discussion in the future.

In essence, building a successful company is about more than just hiring the right people for specific roles. It's about creating an ecosystem where talent thrives, leaders support each other across departments, and where everyone is aligned towards a common vision.
