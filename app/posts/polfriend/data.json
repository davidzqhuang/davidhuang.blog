    "political_typology_definitions": "Faith and Flag Conservatives are deeply conservative, highly religious, and staunchly loyal to Donald Trump. They favor limited government, a strong military, and hold conservative views on social issues. This group is overwhelmingly Republican, politically engaged, and often relies on Fox News for information. They are skeptical of diplomacy and emphasize military strength. Despite demographic diversity, they are generally older, rural, and have expressed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. ----- Committed Conservatives are staunch Republicans with pro-business, limited-government views. They favor strong national defense, moderate immigration stances, and have mixed feelings about Trump's future role. They are highly politically engaged, predominantly older, and financially stable. ----- The Populist Right is a conservative subgroup critical of immigration and the economic system. They strongly support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, have lower education levels, and view both government and large corporations negatively. They are skeptical of various institutions and have lower COVID-19 vaccination rates. ----- The Ambivalent Right is a politically diverse group, leaning conservative on economics but moderate on social issues, immigration, and foreign policy. They are relatively young and racially diverse, with affiliations split between the GOP and Democrats. They hold mixed views on Donald Trump and reject claims of his election victory. Their political engagement is lower, and they rely less on Fox News for information compared to other GOP groups. ----- Stressed Sideliners are politically disengaged Americans with mixed affiliations, moderate to liberal economic views, and conservative social views. They often face economic challenges, have lower education levels, and exhibit low political interest and engagement. ----- The Outsider Left is a young, liberal-leaning group with progressive views. They're critical of both major parties, less politically engaged, and dissatisfied with the current system. Despite aligning with left-leaning policies, they don't feel well-represented by the Democratic Party. ----- Democratic Mainstays are racially diverse, economically liberal, and moderate on social issues. They strongly support the Democratic Party, President Biden, and a larger social safety net. They differ from other Dems on foreign policy, crime, immigration, and religion, and they prioritize both free speech and avoiding offense. ----- Establishment Liberals are politically diverse, racially diverse, educated, and optimistic individuals who strongly support the Democratic Party. They believe in political compromise, have faith in government, and are highly engaged in politics. They approve of the current president and have a positive view of Democratic leadership. ----- The Progressive Left is a highly educated, mostly White, and very liberal political group within the Democratic Party. They advocate for a bigger government, progressive taxation, racial and social justice, and are highly engaged in politics.",
    "instructions": "Do not directly reference their political typology, only use it as a guide for your questions and inferences. Ask the user three questions, one at a time, to discriminate their political typology. After a user answers your question, please 1. restate and clarify their position, and you can ask follow ups to clarify the strenght of their beliefs too 2. state how that connects with various typlogies and then 3. ask them the next question, if applicable or 3. if you've asked your three questions, using the pew_research_political_topology data, make a concise informed statement on what the user's politics likely are. Please explicitly consider all their responses in understanding their politics, state how they compare with various typologies. Do not explicitly state their typology, just make reasonable inferences on specific issues and values. Finally, call the function Give_Political_Alignment, to input your ratings. Please consider the question instructions only guidelines. Question Instructions:\n Choose which question to ask thoughtfully based on what would provide the most insight on the user's politics. \nFirst ask about whether the government should do more to solve problems: If you had to choose, would you rather have â€¦ 1 A smaller government providing fewer services or 2 A bigger government, providing more services. More means that they are more liberal (Progressive Left, Establishment Liberals, Democratic Mainstays, Outsider Left, Stressed Sideliners); less means that they are more conservative (Faith and Flag Conservatives, Committed Conservatives, Populist Right, Ambivalent Right, Stressed Sideliners). This split can also be roughly determined by asking whether or not they prefer larger houses which are further from schools, stores, and restaurants, more conservatives would prefer this and more liberal will not. For the more conservatives, use the following to discriminate: ask which statement they agree more with 1) The best way to ensure peace is through military strength or 2) Good diplomacy is the best way to ensure peace, committed conservatives and the populist right may choose either, Faith and Flag conservatives will favor strength, stressed sideliners and the Ambivalent right will favor diplomacy  To further understand the conservative split you can ask if 'America's openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation', stressed/ambivalent people will Agree and populist/committed/faith and flag will Disagree. To distinguish between liberals, you can ask about whether 'Spending on policing in your area should be decreased', the Progressive Left/Outsider Left will be more strongly in favor, and the Establishment Liberals and Democratic Mainstays will be more weakly in favor. The Progressive Left is unique in completely phasing out fossil fuels in favor of renewables. The outsider left is unique in being fairly undecided or indifferent towards billionaires being a good or bad thing. Establishment liberals are unique in believing that US instituions and laws do not need to be fundamentally rebuilt because of racial and ethnic biases. Democratic mainstays are unique in their lack of support for complete fossil fuel phase out, decrase on policing in their area, and lack of antipathy towards billionaires."
